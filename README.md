# Mindstorm
This was a school project that I have worked on in 2015-2016. The project was to work with Lego Mindstorm robots
and create an application that can make the robot follow a colored line from point A to point B (mainly..), with 
few challenges on the way (Curves, Cuts, Path intersections, etc...). 
You can see the final result in the video Video.url.
